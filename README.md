## Overview

Focus Flow is an application designed to enhance your productivity and concentration by integrating the Pomodoro technique with calming soundscapes and breathing exercises. The app is crafted to help you maintain focus during work sessions, while also offering tools to reduce stress and enhance mindfulness during breaks.

## How to Use

### Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro timer allows you to customize the duration of your work sessions and breaks. Adjust these settings as needed, and any modifications will take effect in the next cycle without disrupting your current focus. For immediate changes, simply hit the reset button on the navigation bar to start the current session anew.

Focus Flow is built to minimize interruptions while keeping you on track. A gentle chime signals the end of each session or break, but the next cycle will only begin when you're ready. If you need to skip ahead, a skip button is conveniently located at the bottom right of the screen.

### Breathing Meditation

During breaks, the timer offers an optional guided breathing exercise. This feature helps you regulate your breathing by following a visual aid, which expands and contracts on the screen. You can personalize the duration of inhalations, exhalations, and breath holds in the settings. While preset breathing patterns will soon be available, you may explore techniques like:

- **Box Breathing**: Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s
- **Triangle Breathing**: Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s
- **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s

The breathing meditation is accessible at any time through the app's navigation bar.

### Soundscapes

Focus Flow also includes a selection of ambient soundscapes that you can layer and adjust to create a personalized atmosphere. This feature will be expanded in future updates, allowing you to craft the perfect background to support your concentration and relaxation.
